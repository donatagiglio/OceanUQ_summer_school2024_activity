As the drifter SST uncertainties are significantly smaller than the MUR SST uncertainties, we will initially make the (probably incorrect) assumption that the drifters are given us the true SST data. To advance the comparison, we suggest removing any significantly outlying SST drifter data:  First use the flag information to select drifter data with quality flag 4 or more, and further remove the remaining outliers and apply a cutoff based on the data difference. Please experiment with this cutoff: 1 or 2 K or anything else. Redo the plots in Question 1 to check if outliers are removed. What percentage of the data are eliminated as such?\n"
